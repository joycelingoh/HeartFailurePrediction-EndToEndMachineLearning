# HeartFailurePrediction-EndToEndMachineLearning
#### Heart Disease Prediction - End-to-End ML Pipeline

#### This project was developed as part of the Assurance of Learning assignment for the Machine Learning course. It implements a full machine learning workflow to predict heart disease using structured clinical data.

## Dataset
#### Source: Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction Dataset
#### Records: 918 patients
#### Features: 11 clinical indicators (e.g., age, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.)

## Workflow
#### Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical tests, visualizations, correlation analysis
#### Feature Engineering: Polynomial feature generation, PCA for dimensionality reduction
#### Modeling: Trained and tuned 7 classifiers (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, SVM, XGBoost)
#### Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV
#### Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Output
#### Final results summarized in an infographic-style poster for presentation.
